  (likely a race condition since the error did not happen every time).

- testfiles/image.wic: added cert and factory partition
- identity, enrollment and adu config get written to factory partition
- certificates get written to cert partition

## [0.6.0] Q4 2021

- cicd: added parent pipeline to get rid of using $fly for pipeline update
- cicd: adapt to new rust builder image

## [0.5.1] Q4 2021

## [0.5.0] Q4 2021

  /dev/loop devices for lo-setup; without this fix it is possible that cli
  commands using the backend deadlock

## [0.2.3] Q3 2021

- frontend:
  - at buildtime: enable overwriting of used default backend docker registry via env var `ICS_DM_CLI_DOCKER_REG_NAME`

  device rules to enable usage of losetup
